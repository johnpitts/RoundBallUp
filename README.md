Using statistics model to predict winning teams of 2020 season
Complex nested network calls to sportradar to access statistics of all NBA players
Complex model classes due to wonky nature of sportradar's API JSON

Future release:  Will add additional "settings" page to allow user access to many traditional statistical grading models such as PER, BPM, WinShares, etc... including the ability for highly analytical basketball scouts to enter their own coefficients to box score statistics for a customized ranking.

Ideal Use:  NBA Scouts on-the-go, allows them quick way to access statistical grading mechanisms approved by Sports organization.

Breadth:  Can make similar apps for any sport, so long as the organization pays the API fees associated with usage.
